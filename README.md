Hey there, Discord enthusiasts! üëã

Are you tired of dealing with pesky ghost pings on your server? üëª Look no further than the Reliable Ghost Ping Module! This powerful tool is designed to help you effectively detect and handle ghost ping incidents, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable Discord experience for everyone. üåü

**What is a Ghost Ping?**

A ghost ping occurs when a user deletes a message that mentions another user, leaving the pinged user with a notification but no visible message. This can be annoying and disruptive, especially if it happens frequently.

**How does the Reliable Ghost Ping Module Work?**

The Reliable Ghost Ping Module works by monitoring message deletions in real-time. When a message is deleted within 15 seconds of being sent and contains a mention of another user, the module generates an embed message containing information about the pinger, the pinged user, and the deleted message's content.

This embed message is then sent to a specified log channel or to the pinger's DM if no log channel is provided. The message includes two buttons: one to delete the ghost ping message and one to close it. Only the pinger and the pinged user can interact with these buttons.

**Benefits of Using the Reliable Ghost Ping Module:**

- **Effective Ghost Ping Detection:** The module quickly detects ghost pings within 15 seconds of message deletion, ensuring prompt action.
- **Detailed Embed Messages:** The generated embed messages provide comprehensive information about the ghost ping incident, including the pinger, pinged user, and deleted message content.
- **Actionable Buttons:** The embed messages include buttons that allow the pinger and pinged user to delete or close the ghost ping message, promoting effective resolution.
